# C-Playground 🛝
I will use this repository to track my progress as I learn C programming. After learning a section and reviewing it from the tutorial, I will recreate it in my ✨own style✨ and publish it here.

This is not a finished project — it’s a scratchpad for learning.

This list will grow as I add more experiments.
